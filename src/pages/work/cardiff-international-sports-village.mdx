    <p>In 2004 Orion was appointed as Cardiff Council's master development partner for the regeneration of the 80 acre Cardiff Bay site. We regenerated the contaminated site delivering new road infrastructure, an award-winning 50m Commonwealth standard swimming pool and associated leisure, a new temporary arena for the Cardiff Ice Devils, a white water rafting centre and significant retail space as well as securing planning permission for 1,000 bay-side homes.</p>
